# ChainVault Presentation - Speaker Notes

## Opening Hook (First 10 seconds are CRUCIAL)

**Start Strong:**
"Imagine you're Pfizer shipping $10 million in vaccines. You need to prove delivery for payment, but revealing the route exposes you to theft. Today's supply chains force an impossible choice: transparency OR privacy. ChainVault gives you both."

**Pause for effect**

## Q&A Preparation

### Likely Questions & Strong Answers

**Q: "How do you handle network effects?"**
A: "We bootstrap with single-company private chains, then interconnect. Like email - started internal, went global."

**Q: "What about quantum computing threats?"**
A: "Midnight uses quantum-resistant cryptography. We're future-proof."

**Q: "Why hasn't anyone done this before?"**
A: "ZK technology just matured. Midnight just launched. We're at the perfect timing inflection."

**Q: "What's your moat?"**
A: "First mover on Midnight, 2 patents pending, and enterprise relationships that take years to build."

**Q: "Revenue model?"**
A: "0.1% of transaction value. One $10B customer = $10M revenue. SaaS for smaller players."

## Energy & Delivery Tips

### Voice & Pace

- **Use pauses:** After big numbers or key points

### Body Language

### Confidence Builders
